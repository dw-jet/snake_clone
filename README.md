# snake-demo

I went to an interview the other day and the interviewer mentioned he wanted to assign some homework, but he wasn't allowed to due to company policy. 
It was a simple assignment to remake the classic snake game as found on the old Nokia cell phones. 
The more I thought I about the more I liked the idea so I decided to give it a shot. I also decided to document all of my thinking along
the way so I have something to point to about how I solve problems.

## Parameters (self imposed)
__No game engine:__
I decided to forego using a game engine since the point seemed to be to make sure I understood (or could figure out) manipulating objects in 
space. No need to download a game engine for that when it's simple enough to animate things with javascript+canvas.

*I should note I'm not a big javascript developer. I know it, I use it, but I don't consider myself a javascript guy.* 

__Doable in a couple of days:__
In the spirit of a homework like scenerio this needs to be done in a couple of days.

See session1.md for a breakdown of my first session.
